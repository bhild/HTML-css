    <h1>Works inspired by Lovecraft</h1>
    <p>There are many works that are inspired by lovecraft. One of the works that gained an immense amount of popularity is Bird Box. While not a direct inspiration it has its roots deep in Lovecraftian horror.</p>

    <p>There is also a show that is coming out this year called Lovecraft country. It is directly inspired by Lovecraft's work. Other than films and movies inspired by his work there are many short stories. The Book of Cthulhu is one example of a spin-off work. There are countless spin-offs and expansions upon his work written by other authors.</p>
    <p>Here some similarities and differences between cosmic horror and birdbox</p>
