    <p class = "boxwshadow">This is a project about H.P. Lovecraft. He is a writer who defined a new genre of horror, now known as Lovecraftian horror. He was born August 20, 1890 and died on March 15, 1937, he published many short stories in pulp fiction magazines. He went under appreciated at the time, despite now being recognized as one of the most important 20th century supernatural horror writers. His influence is still found in many works today. The theme in Lovecraft's work is the idea of humanity's place in an infinite, uncaring universe, where the conceptions of reality are fluid. In cosmic horror (another term of Lovecraftian horror) much of the terror comes from looking too deep and discovering something best left untouched, or running into something beyond human understanding. Most of the time it leaves the protagonist insane, dead or both. The style employed in cosmic horror is more metaphysical in nature, there is little blood, bones and corpses. Characters in Lovecraftian stories never seem to be able to prevail, only ever dealing setbacks or being completely at the mercy of entities beyond human comprehension. The people in Lovecraftian horror never seem to find the answer to the questions they seek, or if they do the answer just makes more questions. Characters have little characterization, they are insignificant beings in this style of story.</p>
